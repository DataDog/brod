Welcome to brod's documentation!
================================

brod is a Python client for the Kafka distributed publish/subscribe messaging 
service. It started as a fork of `pykafka <https://github.com/dsully/pykafka>`_, 
but became a total rewrite as we started adding features.

It's named after Max Brod, Franz Kafka's friend and supporter.
